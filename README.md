<!-- About Me Section -->

💻 I have over 5 years of experience in software development, focusing on **backend solutions, APIs, computer vision projects**, and **AI** applications.

🏢 I currently work as a **Backend Software Engineer** at **Ateliware**, collaborating with cross-functional teams on projects across multiple sectors. Previously, I worked as a **Computer Vision Engineer** at **4Vision**, developing image analysis pipelines for satellite imagery, retail analytics, and Industry 4.0.

📚 My main interests are backend development and areas of Artificial Intelligence, including Image Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and LLMs. I enjoy working with international and cross-functional teams and adapting to different tech stacks in agile environments.

🚀 I'm familiar with many tools and frameworks such as OpenCV, scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, LangChain, LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector databases, SQL, NoSQL, Django Rest Framework, Flask, FastAPI, Beautiful Soup, SQLAlchemy, Python, Node.js, Git, and Docker. I have also practical experience with AWS services and integrating third-party APIs.

❤️ As a Software Engineer, I'm passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems.

📍 Based in **Santa Catarina, Brazil**.
